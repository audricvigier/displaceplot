Title: A suite of R routine to process DISPLACE simulation output files
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: Francois Bastardie fba@aqua.dtu.dk
Description: DISPLACE simulation generates a lot of text output files
 that need some post-processing to make the most out of them and plot the data correctly. 
 However this suite of routines is only a suggestion and the user might think about creating his own set derived
 from the ones presented here.
