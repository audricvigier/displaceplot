Title: A suite of R routine to process DISPLACE simulation output files
Version: 0.1
Author: Francois Bastardie
Maintainer: Francois Bastardie <fba@aqua.dtu.dk>
Description: DISPLACE simulation generates a lot of text-based output files
    which need some post-processing to make the most out of them and 
	plot the data correctly. We suggest here a suite of routines to treat them. 
    However this suite of routines is only a suggestion and 
    the DISPLACE user might think about creating his own set derived
    from the ones presented here.
